      NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR: /mnt/appdata/library # Allows to set the host directory for Nextcloud's datadir. ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Warning: do not set or adjust this value after the initial Nextcloud installation is done!

      NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT: /mnt/appdata/library/Media # Allows the Nextcloud container to access the chosen directory on the host. See https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-allow-the-nextcloud-container-to-access-directories-on-the-host

If it should not exist on your host, don't set this to true as otherwise the Nextcloud container will fail to start! See https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-enable-hardware-acceleration-for-nextcloud

#   # Alternatively, use Tailscale if you don't have a domain yet. See https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/6817
#   # Hint: You need to uncomment APACHE_PORT: 11000 above, adjust cloud.example.com to your domain and uncomment the necessary docker volumes at the bottom of this file in order to make it work
